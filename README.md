# Alessandro Maccario's Personal Page

A personal webpage to share my past and present knowledge about different topics, mainly computer science related ones.

### Why?

The reasons why I built my own webpage/blog page is twofold:

- Increase my visibility on the web through a custom personal webpage;
- [Knowledge Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) and [Public Learning](https://dev.to/blackgirlbytes/how-to-learn-in-public-1coh): build my own knowledge archive to describe how I approached and solved a certain problem/task, and what I've learnt in the process. This way of documenting my journey on learning new concepts should improve my way of exposing content to others.

### How?

My own blog built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Have a look at my [How to Start Blogging with Hugo](https://alessandro-maccario.github.io/the_constant_deviation/blogs/how-to-start-blogging-with-hugo/) about the steps followed.
